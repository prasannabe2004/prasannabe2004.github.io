Hi. My name is Prasanna, and I love Linux, C, C++, Networking, Embedded programming. I am currently a Distinguished Engineer at Amazon Devices, where I work on the next generation high-performance Connectivity software for Amazon devices. I have also spent many years in developing software for inflight entertainment systems. This blog serves as my technical notes, written in a way thatâ€™s easy for anyone to understand, with hands-on learning opportunities where applicable.
